# Garbage Classification
This work is on [Kaggle Garbage Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification) which has 15,150 images from 12 different classes.
The different classes are paper, cardboard, biological, metal, plastic, green glass, brown glass, white glass, clothes, shoes, batteries, and trash.

In this work, I trained EfficientNet-B0 with 86% Accuracy.
